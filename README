---- Warning Incoherence inside Subject -----
There is an incoherence inside the subject. Page 12, the subjet says "Your program will not display
anything on the standard or error outputs." but page 16, we get an example of a printed message.

We also print a message for process detection.

To print no messages at all, remove the 2 instructions "syscall" inside "print_string" function.
